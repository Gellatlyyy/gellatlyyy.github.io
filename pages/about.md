# Welcome To My Website!

## About Me


If you have not already figured this part out, my name is Cameron Gellatly.
I am based in Perth, Western Australia.

In 2022, I completed a Bachelor of Science (Cyber Security) at Edith Cowan University. This course has provided me with a foundation knowledge of networking, network security, scripting & coding, red & blue team operations, and many more essential cyber security concepts.

I am currently working as a Service Technician at a Managed Service Provider â€“ started August 2021. I was employed as a level 1 technician and quickly progressed to level 2. I am now taking on extra responsibilities, working alongside and learning from senior technicians to gain new skills. As the most senior Level 2 technician, I am often training and advising junior team members.


## Why create this website?


I have created this website for multiple reasons.

1. To document my projects for myself and others to learn from.
2. To re-enforce my learning. As they say in the medical field; see one, do one, teach one. 
    Creating content for this website will be acting as my "Teach". 
3. To create a comprehensive resume for future employment opportunities.


## Current Learning / Projects

My current ambition is to complete a CCNA 200-301 Certification by the end of 2023. I am currently following along with a Udemy course by Neil Anderson. In addition to this course, I have purchased textbooks which I am working through (slowly).

In addition to the CCNA course, I am also growing my Cyber Security knowledge by completing TryHackMe challenges as well as personal projects such as setting up a home-lab.
