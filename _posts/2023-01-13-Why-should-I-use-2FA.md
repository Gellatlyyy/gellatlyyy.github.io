# What is 2FA and why should you care?

As an employee, your role in protecting your company's valuable assets is crucial. One of the most effective ways to do this is by using Two-factor authentication (2FA).

By using 2FA, you are not only protecting your personal information, but also your company's sensitive data. By taking the extra step to secure your online accounts with 2FA, you are demonstrating your commitment to the security and success of the company.

2FA is a security measure that requires a second form of verification in addition to a password. This second form of verification can be a one-time code sent to a mobile device, an authentication application, or a security token. It's like adding an extra lock to the safe that holds important and valuable information, making it much harder for someone to break in and steal the valuable information inside.

By using 2FA, you are also protecting against phishing attempts. Phishing is a common tactic used by hackers to steal passwords. With 2FA, even if you fall for a phishing attempt and give away your password, the hacker will not be able to access your account without the second form of verification.

2FA is also easy to set up and use, most online services and platforms now offer it as an option. So, it's a small step that can make a big difference in protecting your company's data and assets.

In conclusion, as an employee, your role in protecting your company's valuable assets is crucial. By using Two-factor authentication (2FA) to secure your online accounts, you are demonstrating your commitment to the security and success of the company. It's easy to set up and use and it provides an extra layer of security against hackers and phishing attempts. Remember that the security of the company's data is just as important as protecting your own personal information. You are valued, and your effort in using 2FA is appreciated.
