# The Security Risks of Working from Home.

The shift towards remote work, also known as working from home (WFH), has brought about a new set of security challenges for businesses. As more employees access company networks and data from personal devices and home networks, the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches increases.

One major threat is the use of personal devices that may not have the same level of security as company-owned devices. These devices are often vulnerable to malware and other attacks, putting company data at risk. Furthermore, employees may engage in risky behavior, such as clicking on suspicious links or sharing login credentials, when working from home.

Another threat is the use of unsecured home networks. Many employees may not be aware that their home network is not secure and may not take the necessary steps to protect it, leaving company data open to attacks from hackers.

Managed service providers (MSPs) can assist businesses in addressing these threats by implementing security measures such as:

1. Virtual private networks (VPNs) to encrypt data and protect it from hackers. VPNs create a secure connection between the employee's device and the company's network, ensuring that all data transmitted is encrypted and protected from prying eyes.
2. Two-factor authentication to protect against stolen login credentials. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring employees to provide a second form of identification, such as a fingerprint or one-time code, to access company resources.
3. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Remote Desktop Services (RDS) for remote access to company resources. This can provide a secure way for employees to access company data and applications from personal devices, while still maintaining control over company data.
4. Endpoint protection software to detect and prevent malware. This includes antivirus and anti-malware software, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems that can identify and block malicious activity on employees' devices, protecting company data from attack.
5. Regular employee training and education to help employees understand the risks of remote work and take steps to protect company data. This can include information on identifying phishing attempts, creating strong passwords, and securing personal devices.

In conclusion, WFH has brought about new security challenges for companies. However, with the help of MSPs, businesses can take the necessary steps to protect their data and secure their remote workforce by implementing security measures such as VPNs, Two-factor authentication, Remote Desktop solutions, and Endpoint protection.
