3. Cloud Hosting - Cloud hosting is a service that allows businesses to store, manage, and process their data and applications on remote servers accessed via the internet.

4. Anti-virus software - Anti-virus software is a program that helps protect a computer from malware, including viruses, Trojan horses, and spyware.

5. Endpoint protection - Endpoint protection is a security solution designed to protect a computer or device from cyber threats. It typically includes anti-virus software, a firewall, and other security features.

6. Firewall - A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

7. Managed Service Provider (MSP) - A Managed Service Provider is a company that provides IT services to other businesses, including network management, data backup, and security.

8. Backup - Backup refers to the process of making copies of data that can be used to restore the original data in case of data loss.

9. Two-factor authentication (2FA) - Two-factor authentication is a security feature that requires users to provide two forms of identification, such as a password and a fingerprint, to access an account.

10. Offsite Backups - Offsite backups refers to the practice of making copies of data and storing it in a location that is physically separate from the primary data storage location, for the purpose of disaster recovery.
