# Remote (WFH) Solutions for Small to Medium Businesses.

Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are facing new challenges as the shift towards remote work has become necessary due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With limited resources, SMBs need to implement cost-effective solutions to ensure employees can work efficiently and securely while away from the office. Managed Service Providers (MSPs) can assist SMBs in implementing these solutions.

One of the most essential solutions for remote work is the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access workstations in the office. This allows employees to connect to their office computer and access all the necessary files and applications as if they were physically in the office. MSPs can assist SMBs with the setup and management of these solutions to ensure that they are properly configured and secure, without breaking the bank.

Another important solution for remote work is the deployment of remote desktop servers. These servers allow employees to access their work computer from any device, even if it is not their own. MSPs can assist SMBs with the installation, configuration, and management of these servers to ensure that they are secure and reliable, even with limited resources.

In addition to these solutions, MSPs can also assist SMBs in implementing cloud-hosted services such as SharePoint. These services allow employees to collaborate and share files remotely, and MSPs can assist with the setup and management of these services to ensure that they are properly configured and secure, while being cost-effective.

To keep these solutions secure, MSPs can assist SMBs in implementing anti-virus and endpoint detection software. These software solutions can help detect and prevent malware and other security threats, and MSPs can assist SMBs with the installation, configuration, and management of these solutions to ensure that they are properly configured and updated.

In conclusion, the shift towards remote work has highlighted the importance of reliable and secure WFH solutions for SMBs. Managed Service Providers can assist SMBs in implementing cost-effective solutions such as VPNs, RDP, remote desktop servers, and cloud-hosted services. Additionally, they can assist with implementing anti-virus and endpoint detection software to ensure that these solutions are secure. With the help of MSPs, SMBs can ensure that their employees can continue to work efficiently and securely while away from the office.
